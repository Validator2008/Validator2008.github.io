                <!-- Rewritten intro for keyword intent -->
                <p>
                    After 25+ years in technology, I offer my experience as a <strong>technology executive</strong> 
                    and <strong>fractional VP/CTO</strong> helping high-growth companies scale their
                    <strong>engineering organisations</strong>, <strong>platforms</strong>, and
                    <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>. I’ve led engineering organisations through hyper-growth, transformation, 
                    and “this really shouldn’t be down” moments, turning chaos into scalable platforms, sane processes, 
                    and teams that actually enjoy shipping.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, I lead engineering at <strong>Redcare Pharmacy</strong>, where 170+ engineers keep Europe’s largest
                    e-pharmacy running across eRX, webshop, apps, payments, and multi-country operations. My focus areas
                    include <strong>platform engineering</strong>, <strong>SRE and observability</strong>,
                    <strong>cost and performance optimisation</strong>, and
                    <strong>engineering leadership coaching</strong>.
                </p>

                <!-- Original narrative kept, now following the more keyword-rich intro -->
                <p>
                    Before this, I was <strong>CTO at Codility</strong>, steering the company through a market downturn,
                    a refinancing, and a tech transformation—simultaneously increasing release velocity and keeping customer
                    satisfaction above 95%. I also cut AWS costs by 45% in four months, which confused enough people that I
                    had to assure them nothing important had been unplugged. Acting as interim Head of Product, I helped teams
                    ship more in one quarter than they had in the previous year. Turns out clarity, discovery, and outcome
                    focus work wonders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before that, I built and scaled platform, infrastructure, SRE, and quality organizations at companies
                    like <strong>Getir</strong>, <strong>HelloFresh</strong>, and <strong>RSA Security</strong>. From turning infrastructure into a
                    self-service developer platform, to reducing MTTR below 40 minutes, to saving hundreds of thousands
                    per month in cloud costs, the theme has been consistent: make systems robust, teams effective, and
                    investments in technology actually pay off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My philosophy is straightforward: engineering is a strategic asset, not a cost center. Great teams
                    outperform great processes. And the job of technology leadership is to create clarity, remove noise,
                    and build organizations capable of solving tomorrow’s problems – not just firefighting today’s.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you’re dealing with scale, complexity, legacy platforms, or organizational growing pains – and
                    you’re looking for someone who will bring experience, challenge your assumptions, and stay focused on
                    outcomes – we should talk. I’m particularly interested in collaborations around platform strategy,
                    org design, engineering excellence, and making technology a genuine competitive advantage rather than
                    an expensive liability.
                </p>

        <div class="about-content">
            <h3>What types of companies do you work with?</h3>
            <p>
                I work with high-growth technology and product companies that need
                <strong>engineering leadership consulting</strong>, <strong>fractional CTO support</strong>, or help
                scaling their <strong>platform engineering</strong> and <strong>SRE</strong> capabilities.
            </p>

            <h3>What problems do you typically solve as a fractional CTO?</h3>
            <p>
                Typical engagements focus on clarifying technology strategy, fixing delivery and reliability issues,
                building <strong>platform engineering</strong> and <strong>observability</strong> practices, and
                redesigning <strong>engineering organisations</strong> for scale.
            </p>

            <h3>Do you offer remote or advisory-only engagements?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Most work is delivered remotely through <strong>CTO advisory</strong> sessions, workshops with
                engineering leadership teams, and structured coaching for managers and tech leads.
